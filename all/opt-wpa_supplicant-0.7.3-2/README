wpa_supplicant notes for Bifrost.

In most cases you'll need to create /etc/config.data/wlan0.nic
most people use dhcpd here. You can copy the sample file.

Also create /etc/config.flags/wlan0.nic with yes/no to control
the usage according to bifrost setup.

It's probably also wise to run wpa_supplicant by hand to make sure 
ESSID and keys are correctly setup.

Example: Tell wpa_supplicant to printout debug info on stdout and 
not run in  background.

/opt/bin/wpa_supplicant -d -c /opt/wpa_supplicant/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0 

iwconfig options can be put in rc.wpa_supplicant

yes in /opt/wpa_supplicant/etc/config.flags/wpa_supplicant for 
automatic start.

Default device is wlan0.
You can change this by putting the devicename in '/opt/wpa_supplicant/etc/config.data/dev'.
