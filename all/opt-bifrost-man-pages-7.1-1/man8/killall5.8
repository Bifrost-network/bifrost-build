.SH DESCRIPTION
.B killall5
is the SystemV killall command. It sends a signal to all processes except
kernel threads and the processes in its own session, so it won't kill
the shell that is running the script it was called from. Its primary
(only) use is in the \fBrc\fP scripts found in the /etc/init.d directory.
.SH OPTIONS

Tells \fIkillall5\fP to omit processes with that process id.
.SH NOTES
\fIkillall5\fP can also be invoked as pidof, which is simply a
(symbolic) link to the \fIkillall5\fP program.
.SH EXIT STATUS

process were killed, and 1 if it was unable to find any processes
(/proc/ is missing).
