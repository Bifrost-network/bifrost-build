.SH NAME
uptime \- Tell how long the system has been running.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uptime
.br
.B uptime
.RB [ \-V ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B uptime
gives a one line display of the following information.
The current time,
how long the system has been running,
how many users are currently logged on,
and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

This is the same information contained in the header line displayed by 
.BR w (1).
.sp
System load averages is the average number of processes that are either 
in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is
either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU. A process in
uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for
disk.  The averages are taken over the three time intervals.
Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so
a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time
while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.
