If you want to NAT the vpn traffic out of the server.
Add to /filter/fwrules:
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

There is an example config file if you want the server to only push selected nets to the client:
/opt/openvpn/etc/server-selected-nets.conf

OpenVPN is certificate based.
If you dont already have a CA then EasyRSA provides a simple CA that works under Bifrost.
