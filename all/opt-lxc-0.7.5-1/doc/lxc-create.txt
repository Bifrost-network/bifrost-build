lxc-create
     Name
     lxc-create — creates a container


     Synopsis
     lxc-create -n name [-f conﬁg_ﬁle] [-t template]



     Description

     lxc-create creates a system object where is stored the conﬁguration informations and where can be
     stored user information. The identiﬁer name is used to specify the container to be used with the different
     lxc commands.


     The object is a directory created in /usr/local/var/lib/lxc and identiﬁed by its name.


     The object is the deﬁnition of the different resources an application can use or can see. The more the
     conﬁguration ﬁle contains informations, the more the container is isolated and the more the application is
     jailed.


     If the conﬁguration ﬁle config_file is not speciﬁed, the container will be created with the default
     isolation: processes, sysv ipc and mount points.



     Options
     -f config_file

          Specify the conﬁguration ﬁle to conﬁgure the virtualization and isolation functionalities for the
          container.

     -t template
          ’template’ is the short name of an existing ’lxc-template’ script that is called by lxc-create, eg.
          busybox, debian, fedora, ubuntu or sshd. Refer to the examples in
          /usr/local/lib/lxc/templates for details of the expected script structure.
